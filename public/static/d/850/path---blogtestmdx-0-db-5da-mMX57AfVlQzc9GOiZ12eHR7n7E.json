How exciting!</p>\n<p>I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.</p>\n<p>Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg\">salted duck eggs</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck\neggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./building.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"May 01, 2015","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/building-9f3c0ddd12aa710f96b9e041aa2b19ff-8a70b.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blogtestmdx/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}}}
